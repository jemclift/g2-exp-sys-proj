        <p>Ecobyte is a sustainability app that we have developed to specifically focus on environmental sustainability.<br>This specific section of sustainability means finding a balance that allows for the consumption of resources to match<br>that of replenishment of these same resources. This is a practice that is very difficult to find and even more difficult to keep.<br>There are many actions that people can take to improve our levels of sustainability. Our app would hope to make these choices<br>easier to find out about and monitor. Once those choices are found and we know what actions are sustainable, it can become<br>difficult to stick to this regime. There is no sense of reward for individuals and thus no incentive to continue making these sustainable choices.<br>We would like to introduce a solution to this problem by rewarding people for making sustainable choices and rewarding them for continuing to<br>make these choices. The overarching aim of our project is to promote, develop and encourage sustainable lifestyles of any extent.<br>We would like to provide a sense of community recognition and reward on an individual level which would aim to improve sustainable practices.</p>
